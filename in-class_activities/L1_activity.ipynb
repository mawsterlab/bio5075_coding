    "1. You defined a new variable (`mg_ATP`) in terms of other variables. This may seem obvious, but it's a useful principle: variables don't need to be directly assigned their values; they can be defined by operations on other variables. (What data type is `mg_ATP`? Did it inherit the data type of the variables defining it? You can check this using `type()`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Assignment* `=` is not the same as the mathematical equals sign. When you do a molarity calculation on paper, it doesn't matter whether you write the answer on the left or the right side of the equals sign. But in Python, the assigned variable always goes on the left, and the expression that determines its value goes on the right.\n",

    "\n",
    "For example, in **Problem 1** you created the variable `mg_ATP` by multiplying other variables. Python does the multiplcation once, and assigns the answer to `mg_ATP`. The variable name `mg_ATP` points to a single value, not the equation in your code.\n",

That object can be an integer, string, float, etc., or more complex data types that we discuss later. In the code for problem one, the multiplication is performed to produce a number (11.022), and then `mg_ATP` points to that value. \n",
