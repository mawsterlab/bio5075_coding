    "# Part 0: Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "In class we discussed a few important features of variables in Python and Jupyter notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables can be assigned different types of data**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main simple data types are these:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "gene = 'CDC28'            # string (str) - any sequence of characters placed within quotes\n",
    "n_mice = 13               # integer (int)\n",
    "protein_level = 1.76      # floating-point numbers (float) - numbers with decimals\n",
    "is_present = True         # boolean (bool) - True or False, also 0 or 1 can be interpreted as boolean\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**A variable assigned one type of data can be reassigned to another type of data**\n",
    "\n",
    "As your code gets more complex, sometimes you'll find that a variable hasn't been assigned the data type you expect - such as the string `'1'` rather than the integer `1`. If it's not obvious what type a variable is, you can use the `type()` function to determine what type of value a variable holds.\n",
    "\n",
    "One feature of Python not present in some other languages is that a variable can be reassigned values of different types:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "data = 123.4     # type is float\n",
    "data = 'CGCG'    # type is now string\n",
    "data = '123.4'   # type is still string - not a numeric type.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can convert variables from one type to another. For example, if you have a number stored a string, you can convert it to a numeric type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "data = '123.4'     # type is string - can't use it for math\n",
    "data = float(data) # Now you can use the value for math\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables defined from other variables are NOT automatically updated when you change other variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike math variables, computer variables can't be defined by other variables. Instead, computer variables are assigned whatever specific value was calculated from the variables on the right side of the assignment operator (`=`), at the time the assignment is made.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "test_value = 21\n",
    "control_value = 3\n",
    "\n",
    "fold_change = test_value/ control_value # fold-change is assigned the value of 7\n",
    "\n",
    "control_value = 4 # value of fold_change is not affected by this subsequent line of code.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables will capture the result of whatever happens to the right of the assignment operator**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, the function (more properly, the *method*) `.count()` is used to count the occurrences of 0 in the list `some_data`. The *output* of `some_data.count(0)` is 2. In order to store this result for future use, the output of `some_data.count(0)` is assigned to the variable `zeros`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "some_data = [2, 6, 0, 7, 3, 0]\n",
    "zeros = some_data.count(0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simple example, but the principle is not trivial. As you write and debug more complex code, you'll likely run into cases in which your code performs some calculation whose output gets lost, because it's not being assigned to a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables don't care about the order of cells in your notebook**\n",
    "The line numbers to the side of your code cells (`In [1]:`) show the order in which cells were run, and that is what really matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you change the value of a previously defined variable in a lower cell, re-running an upper cell will reflect that changed value. (The exception is when the upper cell has a line that sets the variable to its original value.) \n",
    "\n",
    "This can quickly lead to problems as you try to troubleshoot your code. The best way to avoid these problems is to try to make your code in each cell as self-contained as possible, defining all needed variables within a single cell. This isn't always possible or practical, so it's good to be aware of this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "If, as you edit cells out of order, the state of your variables has become hopelessly confusing, it's best to just restart the Python interpreter. Click on the **Kernel** menu above, and select **\"Restart & Clear Output\"**. This will reset your Python session, clearing all variable assignments and output. Don't worry, it will not erase your work - your code will still be there. In fact, it's a good idea to try this with your homework to make sure all code runs without errors. (Select **\"Restart & Run All\"** to clear the Python session and automatically run all cells in order).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 0.1 (1 point): Complete the following in the cell below\n",
    "Imagine that you have measured an expression value for the gene *Gli1*. In the cell below, do the following three things: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a variable called `gene` and assign it the gene name Gli1. (What data type is the gene name? Don't answer this question in the code cell - just answer it for yourself.)\n",
    "2. Create a variable called `expression` and assign it the value 2.5. (What data type is this?)\n",

That is, you specify the position in the list you want to access, *starting with 0*. (Remember, computer scientists start counting at 0. This will be a common theme in your computational work.) Because lists are *ordered*, you access individual items by their position in the list.\n",

    "### Combining list manipulations\n",
    "\n",
    "In this last problem, you'll practice combining indexing with the `.append()` function to add a number from the list `more_numbers` to our list `numbers`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall how in class we used `.append()` to add a **single** item to the end of a list. (`.pop()` removes items from the end of a list - though as you'll see later in the class, taking items off a list turns out to not be as useful as appending items.)\n",
    "\n",
    "(What about putting items in the middle or beginning of a list? There are functions to do this, but using them is generally a bad idea. Unlike `.append()` and `.pop()`, inserting items in the middle of a list causes the position of every item in to change. Remember, lists are ordered, and store data by position. It is computationally slow to update the position of every item in lists with thousands of, say, gene expression measurements. Inserting things in the middle of lists makes bug-free coding harder.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of using `.append()`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "nucleosides = ['deoxyadenosine', 'deoxyguanosine', 'deoxythymidine'] # We're missing one!\n",
    "nucleosides.append('deoxycytidine') # Adds to end of list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 1.4 (2 points)\n",
    "In this problem, you'll combine list indexing with the `.append()` function. In the cell below, *use just one line of code* to take the middle letters c, d, and e from the list `letters` (using a slice), and append that slice to the list `numbers`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The substance of this problem is trivial, but implementing it in code is a little tricky: you have to take one operation (slicing) and nest it within a function. It's important to practice combinations like this. They are the basis of the powerful data manipulations we'll do using Python lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** If you look at the output of this operation, you'll see that you don't just get one list of numbers followed by some letters. You get a list within a list - the slice from `letters` becomes the last single item of the list `numbers`. Typically this will not be the behavior you want (you should concatenate rather than append one list to another), but for purposes of this problem, it's what I'm asking for."
