Lists are a powerful tool for handling data, and learning how to work with lists is one of the most important skills you'll learn in this class.

    "### Accessing items in a list: Indexing\n",
    "To do something with an entire list, you just use the variable name of that list. But often you want to access individual items in the list. To do this, we use *indexing*. That is, you specify the position in the list you want to access, *starting with 0*. (Remember, computer scientists start counting at 0. This will be a common theme in your computational work.) Because lists are *ordered*, you access individual items by their position in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for example ```numbers[0]``` will give you the first item in the list ```numbers```, which is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Less intuitively, you can use indexing by counting backwards from the end of the list. This can be a little confusing, because, unlike forward indexing, *counting backwards does not start from 0*. Look carefully at the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers[-1] # last item\n",
    "numbers[-3] # third from the last item\n",
    "numbers[-len(numbers)] # first item - can you figure out why? Note the function nested within and index.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Square brackets:** Somewhat confusingly, square brackets are used not only to define lists, but also for list indexing. *Don't confuse these two uses of square brackets!* They are not the same. When the brackets are placed right next to the variable name, they are being used for indexing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers[3]    # Gives you the 4th item in the list named 'numbers'.\n",
    "numbers = [3] # Defines a brand new list (or overwrites an existing one!) with only one item. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To practice indexing, define a new list below, called ```more_numbers``` with four elements, the numbers 10, 11, 12, and 13 (in that order). Then, using indexing, calculate the sum of the **3rd item** from ```numbers``` and the **second-to-last item** in ```more_numbers```.  Assign the answer to a new variable, `answer1`."

    "### Combining list manipulations\n",
    "\n",
    "In this last problem, you'll practice combining indexing with the `.append()` function to add a number from the list `more_numbers` to our list `numbers`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall how in class we used `.append()` to add a **single** item to the end of a list. (`.pop()` removes items from the end of a list - though as you'll see later in the class, taking items off a list turns out to not be as useful as appending items.)\n",
    "\n",
    "(What about putting items in the middle or beginning of a list? There are functions to do this, but using them is generally a bad idea. Unlike `.append()` and `.pop()`, inserting items in the middle of a list causes the position of every item in to change. Remember, lists are ordered, and store data by position. It is computationally slow to update the position of every item in lists with thousands of, say, gene expression measurements. Inserting things in the middle of lists makes bug-free coding harder.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of using `.append()`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "nucleosides = ['deoxyadenosine', 'deoxyguanosine', 'deoxythymidine'] # We're missing one!\n",
    "nucleosides.append('deoxycytidine') # Adds to end of list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, you'll combine list indexing with the `.append()` function. In the cell below, *use just one line of code* to take the number 11 from the list `more_numbers` (with indexing), and append it to the list `numbers`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The substance of this problem is trivial, but implementing it in code is a little tricky: you have to take one operation (indexing) and nest it within a function. It's important to practice combinations like this. They are the basis of the powerful data manipulations we'll do using Python lists."
