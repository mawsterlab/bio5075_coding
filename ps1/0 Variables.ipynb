    "## Problem 0: Working with variables (3 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "*This first problem is mostly a quick recap of what we covered in class (with a few small bonus topics). It may seem tedious to keep going over the same ideas, but the point here is to practice working with Python and Jupyter.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE about homework files:** Feel free to add blank cells anywhere to use as scratch space; it won't affect the grading software. In the notebook menu above, choose \"Insert\", then insert a cell below or above. DO NOT change the filename; that will affect the grading software.\n",
    "\n",
    "In class we discussed a few important features of variables in Python and Jupyter notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables can be assigned different types of data**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main simple data types are these:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "gene = 'CDC28'            # string (str) - any sequence of characters placed within quotes\n",
    "n_mice = 13               # integer (int)\n",
    "protein_level = 1.76      # floating-point numbers (float) - numbers with decimals\n",
    "is_present = True         # boolean (bool) - True or False, also 0 or 1 can be interpreted as boolean\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**A variable assigned one type of data can be reassigned to another type of data**\n",
    "\n",
    "As your code gets more complex, sometimes you'll find that a variable hasn't been assigned the data type you expect - such as the string `'1'` rather than the integer `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember you can use `type()` to determine what type of value a variable holds.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "data = 123.4     # type is float\n",
    "data = 'CGCG'    # type is now string\n",
    "data = '123.4'   # type is still string\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables defined from other variables are NOT automatically updated when you change other variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike math variables, computer variables can't be defined by other variables. Instead, computer variables are assigned whatever specific value was calculated from the variables on the right side of the assignment operator (`=`), at the time the assignment is made.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "test_value = 21\n",
    "control_value = 3\n",
    "\n",
    "fold_change = test_value/ control_value # fold-change is assigned the value of 7\n",
    "\n",
    "control_value = 4 # value of fold_change is not affected by this subsequent line of code.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables will capture the result of whatever happens to the right of the assignment operator**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, the function (more properly, the *method*) `.count()` is used to count the occurrences of 0 in the list `some_data`. The *output* of `some_data.count(0)` is 2. In order to store this result for future use, the output of `some_data.count(0)` is assigned to the variable `zeros`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "some_data = [2, 6, 0, 7, 3, 0]\n",
    "zeros = some_data.count(0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simple example, but the principle is not trivial. As you write and debug more complex code, you'll likely run into cases in which your code performs some calculation whose output gets lost, because it's not being assigned to a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables don't care about the order of cells in your notebook**\n",
    "The line numbers to the side of your code cells (`In [1]:`) show the order in which cells were run, and that is what really matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you change the value of a previously defined variable in a lower cell, re-running an upper cell will reflect that changed value. (The exception is when the upper cell has a line that sets the variable to its original value.) \n",
    "\n",
    "This can quickly lead to problems as you try to troubleshoot your code. The best way to avoid these problems is to try to make your code in each cell as self-contained as possible, defining all needed variables within a single cell. This isn't always possible or practical, so it's good to be aware of this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "If, as you edit cells out of order, the state of your variables has become hopelessly confusing, it's best to just restart the Python interpreter. Click on the **Kernel** menu above, and select **\"Restart & Clear Output\"**. This will reset your Python session, clearing all variable assignments and output. Don't worry, it will not erase your work - your code will still be there. In fact, it's a good idea to try this with your homework to make sure all code runs without errors. (Select **\"Restart & Run All\"** to clear the Python session and automatically run all cells in order).\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a simple example of what happens when you run cells out of order, when they have some variables in common. With more complex code, a cell near the top of your notebook that you rerun might be affected by a variable change that occurred a dozen cells lower down! "
