    "# Problem 2: Running a FOR loop over two lists at the same time (3 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "During the class activities, you worked two lists of reporter gene data (the red and green channels). You normalized the red measurements by the *mean* of the green measurements. But a more typical practice is to normalize each measurement (red channel) by its own corresponding control measurement (green channel).\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do you write a FOR loop to take each red measurement and divide it by its corresponding green measurement? To do this, you need to know how to run a FOR loop over two or more lists at the same time. This skill will be critical in this class. You'll learn how to do that in this problem.\n",
