# bio5075_coding
Repository of lecture notes, files for in-class activities, and homework assignments for the coding portion of BIOL 5075.

Lecture notes for every coding lecture will be available under lecture_notes/.

For in-class activities, download the .ipynb file for the appropriate lecture from in-class_activities/.

After each coding lecture, homework files will be available under homework_files/. DOWNLOAD THE ENTIRE 'PS' DIRECTORY for each homework assignment, as it contains additional data files you'll need. For example, to download problem set 1, download the directory 'ps1' within homework_files/.

To complete your homework, launch Jupyter from within the parent directory that holds your class and homework files. Navigate to the problem set folder (i.e., 'ps1') from the Jupyter dashboard. Use the dashboard to open the problem set notebook and follow the instructions. The notebook has instructions for submitting your homework.
